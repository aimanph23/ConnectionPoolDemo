# Thread Pool Monitoring - Bean Injection Fix

## Issue

When starting the application, you encountered this error:

```
Parameter 0 of constructor in com.example.connectionpool.controller.ThreadPoolMonitoringController 
required a bean of type 'org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskExecutor' 
that could not be found.
```

## Root Cause

The `taskExecutor` bean in `ConnectionPoolDemoApplication.java` was defined with return type `Executor` (interface):

```java
@Bean(name = "taskExecutor")
public Executor taskExecutor() {
    ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
    // ... configuration ...
    return executor;
}
```

However, the `ThreadPoolMonitoringController` was trying to inject the concrete type `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor`:

```java
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class ThreadPoolMonitoringController {
    private final ThreadPoolTaskExecutor taskExecutor;  // ❌ Concrete type not found
}
```

Spring couldn't find a bean of type `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor` because the bean was registered as `Executor`.

## Solution

Modified the `ThreadPoolMonitoringController` to inject the `Executor` interface and cast it to `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor`:

```java
@Slf4j
public class ThreadPoolMonitoringController {
    private final ThreadPoolTaskExecutor taskExecutor;
    
    public ThreadPoolMonitoringController(@Qualifier("taskExecutor") Executor taskExecutor) {
        this.taskExecutor = (ThreadPoolTaskExecutor) taskExecutor;
    }
    // ... rest of the code
}
```

### Changes Made

1. **Removed** `@RequiredArgsConstructor` annotation
2. **Added** explicit constructor with `@Qualifier("taskExecutor")`
3. **Injected** `Executor` interface instead of concrete type
4. **Cast** to `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor` in the constructor

## Why This Works

- Spring finds the bean by name (`taskExecutor`) and type (`Executor`)
- The cast is safe because we know `taskExecutor` returns a `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor` instance
- The controller can now access all `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor` methods for monitoring

## Alternative Solutions (Not Used)

### Option 1: Change Bean Return Type
```java
@Bean(name = "taskExecutor")
public ThreadPoolTaskExecutor taskExecutor() {  // Return concrete type
    ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
    // ...
    return executor;
}
```
**Not chosen** because it would affect other parts of the application that use the `Executor` interface.

### Option 2: Create Separate Monitoring Bean
```java
@Bean(name = "monitoringTaskExecutor")
public ThreadPoolTaskExecutor monitoringTaskExecutor() {
    // Separate bean for monitoring
}
```
**Not chosen** because we want to monitor the actual task executor, not create a new one.

## Verification

After the fix, the application starts successfully:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8080/api/threadpool/health
# Response: Thread Pool Monitoring API is running!

# Get metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/api/threadpool/metrics
# Response: {"activeCount":0,"poolSize":0,...}

# Open dashboard
open http://localhost:8080/dashboard/threadpool
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Bean Type Matching**: Spring matches beans by type, so the injected type must match the bean's declared type
2. **Interface vs Concrete**: When a bean returns an interface, inject the interface and cast if needed
3. **@Qualifier**: Use `@Qualifier` to specify which bean to inject when multiple candidates exist
4. **Constructor Injection**: Explicit constructors give more control over bean injection and validation

## Testing

The thread pool monitoring is now fully functional:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Application is running
mvn spring-boot:run

# Terminal 2: Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:8080/api/threadpool/metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/api/threadpool/details
curl http://localhost:8080/api/threadpool/status

# Browser: Open dashboard
http://localhost:8080/dashboard/threadpool
```

All endpoints work correctly! ✅

## Configuration

Current thread pool configuration from `ConnectionPoolDemoApplication.java`:

- **Core Pool Size**: 10 threads
- **Max Pool Size**: 20 threads
- **Queue Capacity**: 50 tasks
- **Thread Name Prefix**: "async-"

These values are reflected in the monitoring dashboard.
